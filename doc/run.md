# JAETE
## Purpose
Honestly this file is for my personal use. Namely, I am going to keep for of the common test/run commands that I have and perhaps instructions for setting them up.

## Basic setup
Make sure node, npm and electron are installed
```
node -v
npm -v
```

To install electron:
```
npm install electron
```

## Basic run
Open a command window in the project directory. Then call
```
npm start
```

##Deubgging help
Once the app is running you can review the information logged to the console by hitting:
```
ctrl+shirt+I
```
This will open the dev tools, under which the console resides.
